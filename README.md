Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective is simple: players take turns marking a space in the grid with their symbol—usually an "X" or an "O." The first player to get three of their symbols in a row—vertically, horizontally, or diagonally—wins the game.
Game Features:

    Players: Two players (X and O).
    Grid: 3x3 layout.
    Turn-based Play: Players alternate turns.
    Win Conditions: Three symbols in a line, with options for vertical, horizontal, or diagonal lines.
    Draw Option: If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

Game Mechanics:

    Starting the Game: Players decide who goes first, typically X.
    Taking Turns: Players place their symbol in an empty cell during their turn.
    Checking for Winner: After each move, the game checks for a winning combination or a draw.
    Restart Option: Players can choose to start a new game after one finishes.

User Experience:

    Simple and Quick: Each game typically lasts only a few minutes.
    Strategic Thinking: Players must anticipate their opponent's moves and plan accordingly.
    Visual Feedback: The grid updates visually with each turn, showing the current state of the game.
